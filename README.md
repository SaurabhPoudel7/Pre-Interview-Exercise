## TDD Approach

This project was built using the **Red-Green-Refactor** TDD cycle:
1. Write a failing test (`test:` commits)
2. Write the minimum code to pass (`feat:` commits)
3. Refactor for clarity (`refactor:` commits)
4. Repeat until complete

## Tech Stack

- **Java 21** (modern `switch` expressions)
- **Maven** (build tool)
- **JUnit 5** (testing)
- **Git** (version control, tagged commits)
